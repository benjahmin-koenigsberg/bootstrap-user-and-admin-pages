## About this repo

This is an assigment to create two wireframes and matching websites that incorprate Bootstrap classes in the styling

I chose to make a simple design since I had less than 24 hours to complete and its my first website using Bootsrap. As an animal rights activist, I usually look for ways to raisie awareness about the sentience of farmed animals and their unnecessary suffering
